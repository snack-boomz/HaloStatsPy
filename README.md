## Features

1. TBD!

## Running the Project

1. Download the files, which when unzipped will provide you a folder of the files.
2. Open this folder in your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice. Some options include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a Code/text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom.
3. In the provided terminal within the IDE (If you're using sublime text or Atom, ensure to open a separate terminal and change to the project directory, i.e. `cd ~/Downloads/HaloStatsPy` or `cd C:\Users\<Your Username>\Downloads\HaloStatsPy`
4. If Python isn't already installed on your PC, head over to https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download and follow the instructions to install Python, based on what Operating system you are using (Windows/MacOS/Linux, etc).
5. Once python is installed and you are located in the project directory, run the command `python3 -m venv env` or if you're on Windows, run `python -m venv env` ; This creates a virtual environment, an isolated environment for Python projects. More info on this here: https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
6. Activate your virtual environment by running the command `source env/bin/activate` or if you're in Windows, run ` env\Scripts\activate.bat` 
7. To install the required dependencies to run the application, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` ; This is downloading all the required dependencies by parsing through each dependency in the requirements.txt file.
8. Once completed, run the application by running the command `python3 app.py` or if you're on Windows, run `python app.py`
